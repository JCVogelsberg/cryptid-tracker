## Cryptid Mapper

###Epicodus bootcamp exercise in Rails 4
This will be a two day project involving two pair groups: Jay, Paul, Alex, Brentwood, Ashley and Patrick. One objective of this project is to practice collaboration through git.

Our project for today we are creating a cryptid tracker to allow users to sign up, add sightings of crytids and display location using google maps api to help display.

This is a practice app to figure out the Googe Map API.  It will experiment with the <a href="https://github.com/apneadiving/Google-Maps-for-Rails">gmaps4rails</a> as well as just using the documentation from Google.

###Status
